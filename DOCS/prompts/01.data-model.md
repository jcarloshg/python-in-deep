**Role:** Act as a Senior Python Architect and Systems Design Expert.

**Objective:** Create a comprehensive, production-grade example of the "Pythonic Data Model" using Dunder (Magic) methods to solve advanced architectural challenges.

**Path & Structure:**

- **Folder:** `02.Data-Model-Dunder-Methods/`
- **Primary File:** `dunder_protocol_demo.py`
- **Module:** Ensure the example is encapsulated in a clean module structure with appropriate docstrings.

**Task Requirements:**

1. **The `__new__` vs `__init__` Challenge:**

   - Create an **Immutable Configuration Class** (like a Singleton or a Value Object).
   - Override `__new__` to control object creation and `__init__` to show where initialization usually happens.
   - **Scenario:** Use `__new__` to ensure that once a configuration key is set, the object becomes truly immutable or returns a cached instance (Singleton pattern).

2. **The "Duck Typing" Protocol:**

   - Implement a custom collection class that mimics a Python List/Dictionary by using `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, and `__len__`.
   - Implement `__repr__` and `__str__` to demonstrate the difference between developer-facing vs. user-facing string representations.

3. **Technical Annotations:**

   - Add detailed comments explaining the **MRO (Method Resolution Order)** if applicable.
   - Explain exactly when the Python Interpreter calls these methods (the "Hook" mechanism).

4. **Comparison Context:**
   - Add a blockquote or comment section comparing this "Protocol-based" approach to **TypeScript Interfaces**. Explain how Python’s "Duck Typing" removes the need for explicit `implements` keywords.

**Output Format:**

- **File Tree:** Visual layout of the created directory.
- **Code:** Highly professional, PEP-8 compliant code with meaningful variable names and logic.
