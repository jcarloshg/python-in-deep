**Role:** Act as a Senior Python Principal Engineer and Technical Interviewer for high-performance backend roles.

**Objective:** Create a high-impact study guide for a Senior-level Python interview, specifically tailored for a developer coming from a Node.js/TypeScript background.

**Context:** I am a Tech Lead preparing for a Python interview. I need to move beyond basic syntax and master the "Senior" topics: Internals, Memory Management, Concurrency, and the Pythonic Data Model.

**Task Requirements:**

1. **Internals & Execution:** - Explain the CPython Pipeline (Bytecode vs. Runtime).

   - Deep dive into the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**: What is it, why does it exist, and how do we bypass it (Multiprocessing vs. Asyncio)?

2. **The Pythonic Data Model (Dunder Methods):**

   - Explain how `__init__`, `__str__`, `__call__`, and `__getitem__` allow objects to hook into Python's core syntax.

3. **Memory Management:**

   - Explain **Reference Counting** vs. **Generational Garbage Collection**.
   - What are `__slots__` and how do they optimize memory for millions of objects?

4. **Advanced Features:**

   - **Decorators:** How they differ from TypeScript decorators (Function wrappers vs. Metadata).
   - **Generators & Iterators:** How `yield` works and its memory benefits for large datasets.
   - **Context Managers:** The `with` statement and the `__enter__` / `__exit__` lifecycle.

5. **Concurrency & Scoping:**
   - **Threading vs. Multiprocessing:** When to use which?
   - **Scopes:** The LEGB rule (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in).

**Output Format:**

- **Topic Name**
- **The "Senior" Explanation:** (Brief, high-level theory).
- **The "Killer" Interview Question:** A scenario-based question to test depth.
- **Comparison Note:** A brief mention of how this differs from Node.js/TypeScript.
